# TODO


[ ] Fill this `README.md` with per-package description, with each script under the package annotated and briefly explained.

[ ] Rename packages to follow `behav3d_*` naming convention or similar.

[ ] Remove redundant packages that are no longer needed.

[ ] Should we keep relying on OrbbecROS here or can we create our own Camera API? (This is mainly for D2C transform -> https://orbbec.github.io/docs/OrbbecSDK_K4A_Wrapper/main/group___functions.html#gaa3cfbe85228b09612b17f737a3184efd)
