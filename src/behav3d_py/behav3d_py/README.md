# TODO

This is a loaded library and should be documented.

[ ] Move any other util/generic functions here to be called as `behav3d_py.*`

[ ] Consolidate/remove any debug code.

[ ] Rework modules into explicit names. (yaml_parser is for gh but not explicit; you can later import it as `from behav3d_py.gh_yaml_parser as gh`)

[ ] APIs for ModBus, Camera, etc. (i.e. any external system we are communicating with)
